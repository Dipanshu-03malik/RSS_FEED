We respond to predictable crises as if we had had no warning. Lessons from previous disasters go unlearned, mistakes are recycled, failures lodged so deeply that they come to define the system.This is not because of a deficiency in the national character, but because of a deficiency in the ideology of government an elite belief, shared by scarcely any citizens, that public intervention should be used only when all other measures have failed.

Humble peasants  or an odyssey of sex and death? The Millet masterpiece that electrified modern art,"Van Gogh saw compassion for the rural worker Dalí saw phalluses and a childs grave. As The Angelus comes to the UK, our critic celebrates a painting so deep it could even induce hallucinationsIt was Salvador Dalí who turned a small, intense rural scene called The Angelus, painted by Jean-François Millet in 1857-59 and hugely popular in its day, into a totem of modern art.In the original, a pious peasant couple have heard the Angelus bell from a distant church, the Catholic call to prayer, and paused their work digging potatoes to lower their heads and pray. But from Dalís writings, we know he saw far more in the painting, from obscene sex to family tragedy. In one of his many versions of it, Atavism at Twilight, the couple sprout agricultural implements from their bodies. In his surreal drawings these good country people become mouldering, mummified husks, or are transformed into fossils by time and sadness. Now that the original painting is being lent by the Musée dOrsay to the National Gallery as the star of its forthcoming show Millet Life on the Land, we will all get a chance to obsess over this innocent-seeming artwork.

The Sisterhood of Ravensbrück by Lynne Olson review  surviving an all-female concentration camp,"The extraordinary story of the women who fought to bring their Nazi persecutors to justiceShortly after her release from Ravensbrück in 1945, Comtesse Germaine de Renty attended a dinner party in Paris with old friends. One guest complimented her on how well she was looking, concluding that life in Ravensbrück was not nearly as terrible as weve been told. De Renty stared at the woman for a moment, before explaining icily that a typical day in the camp began by stepping over the corpses of friends who had died in the night. They would probably have no eyes, she added, since the rats had already eaten them. And with that, the comtesse stood up and swept out.Ravensbrück always had a credibility issue, explains Lynne Olson in this consistently thoughtful book. The camp, although only 50 miles north of Berlin, had been liberated late, which gave the SS plenty of time to burn incriminating records. There was limited visual evidence, too, since no cameramen accompanied the Soviet army when it knocked down the gates on 30 April 1945. While images from Auschwitz and Dachau of starving prisoners and rotting corpses were flashed before a horrified world, Ravensbrück left little trace in the moral imagination.

Commons at pompous worst as Afghan data breach proves too much bother for Badenoch  John Crace,"No one had anything to say about a cover-up kept secret from parliament, the public and the people whose data was leakedFor a moment it felt as if the dam might be about to burst. To let the anger in. On Tuesday, the Commons had been at its most pompous, most clubbable worst. Drowning in self-righteousness as the defence secretary, John Healey, gave a statement on the leaked Afghan email, the superinjunction and the 850m bill to the taxpayer. It was deeply regrettable, MPs on all sides agreed, but in the end probably just one of those things. Best to move on and not rock the boat. Parliament at its best and all that.On Wednesday, we got to hear Keir Starmers view on the scandal in his opening remarks at prime ministers questions. He seemed to have moved on from Healeys acquiescent cover-up. Yes, Labour in opposition had shared the previous governments commitment to protecting Afghans who had worked for the UK army, but he had consistently warned of the Tories handling of the crisis. The failings were manifold and former ministers had a great deal to answer for. The gloves were off. This was a party political issue.

Rachel Reeves is hoping deregulation will save the economy. We know how that ends  Larry Elliott,"The chancellors emollient speech to City bosses this week was alarming. There are better ways to revive Britains fortunesRachel Reeves was in full Iron Lady mode when she delivered her Mansion House speech to the Citys finest this week. Regulation was acting like a boot on the neck of business, choking off enterprise and innovation. Cutting red tape would have a ripple effect on the whole economy. Regulators should not give way to the temptation of excessive caution but instead boldly regulate for growth.

Now she has gone by mutual agreement.Crews first problem was that she followed a genuine corporate superstar in the form of the late Sir Ivan Menezes, whose strategy of premiumisation  encouraging punters to drink more expensive stuff  did wonders for profit margins year after year.

After spooking markets with tears in the Commons, appearing with the Bank of England governor was damage control. The Leeds reforms were billed as bold, but the real message was a return to business as usual.Delivered to a City audience, the speech confirmed a deregulatory tilt that is striking not for its boldness but for its familiarity. Her reform of the ringfencing regime for banks is code for loosening constraints under pressure from the finance lobby.

Human Traffic review  one-crazy-night 90s clubbing comedy provides euphoric rush of nostalgia,"This loved-up ensemble piece is cheerfully apolitical, pro-drugs and pro-hedonism  and features a very funny film debut from Danny DyerA warm nostalgic glow surrounds this likably daft and zeitgeisty one-crazy-night clubbing adventure from 1999. Its a Cool Britannia time-capsule written and directed by Justin Kerrigan, starring John Simm, Shaun Parkes, Lorraine Pilkington, Nicola Reynolds and a cherubic young Danny Dyer making his movie debut. Dyers character ends up down the pub moodily swearing off drugs for ever  and if we wondered how that was going to turn out, we can flashforward to his performance this year in Nick Loves Marching Powder, in which he does much the same thing.Human Traffic revolves around a group of gurning mates a classic 90s ensemble of mononymous characters  Jip, Koop, Lulu, Nina and Moff  individually introduced in freeze-frame voiceover in that distinctive 90s Britmovie style, as popularised by Danny Boyles Trainspotting and Guy Ritchies Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But those films were from Mars and this one is from Venus. Its a sweeter story of the loved-up. They struggle through terrible jobs in the week and prepare for a massive night out on a Friday involving landlines, smoking indoors, proto-Ali G characters, no smartphones, no social media and some cameos from Howard Marks, Carl Cox and Andrew Lincoln in those days an icon for his role in TVs This Life.

Untamed review  Eric Banas national park thriller is as beautiful as it is totally predictable,"The actor is like Bear Grylls with a badge in a macho Yosemite-set detective drama thats very easy on the eye. Its not the smartest, but the mountains are lovelyUntamed is a blunt force thriller, set in Yosemite national park in California, starring Eric Bana as a macho special agent who prefers silence to talking and horses to motorised vehicles. It is perfectly serviceable though oddly retro  not just because it scoffs at petrol engines, but because it feels as if it could have been made in the 1990s. Even a crucial smartphone plotline doesnt come into it until very close to the end, and although park rangers have become a political hot potato in the US, national politics emphatically do not exist here.That makes Untamed an undemanding watch, but dont expect much depth. Its as easy on the eye as it is straightforward. Bana is Kyle Turner, technically not a park ranger, even though hes dressed like one, but an ISB Special Agent, which gives him extra-special cop powers. Devotees of detective dramas will be shocked to learn that Turner is brusque, rude and has a taste for bourbon that doesnt have any impact on his professional capacity whatsoever. He is haunted by a family tragedy. His personal relationships are poor. He is, of course, excellent at what he does.

Girls gone bad Lena Dunhams Too Much is just not good enough,"The creator of the seminal HBO hit has followed up with an underbaked Netflix background watch, a crushing disappointment for her ardent fanbaseThere is one TV show that has been enjoyed most often, and most reliably, among my cohort in New York Girls, the seminal HBO dramedy about Brooklyns downwardly mobile and highly self-important creative class of the 2010s. Though a cultural lightning rod when it aired from 2012 until 2017  its whiteness, convincing narcissism, frank sexuality and frequent nudity all catnip for the cresting blogosphere and cyclical moral panic  Girls has rightfully settled into its status as one of the best television series of the 21st century, a foundational text for millennials as well as a biting satire of solipsistic, Obama-era striving. Although viewers too young to remember it as anything other than canon now see the girls flailing  their freedom to wear terrible prints, listen to Vampire Weekend and be earnest  as something to be envied rather than derided, a core tenet of the millennial redemption arc.The show was always sharper than tendentious criticism acknowledged, a knowing send-up not to be taken too seriously, though it did seriously shape the TV that followed  the idea of an unlikable female protagonist was always ahistorical, but messy, compelling women on television proliferated in Hannah Horvaths wake, from the girls of Broad City to Insecures Issa, Phoebe Waller-Bridges Fleabag to Pamela Adlons Better Things. It is unfortunately still radical to see someone who looks like creator, writer and star Lena Dunham be naked on screen without judgment though television has explored sex much more successfully than movies in the years since, no show has fully succeeded Girls unvarnished vision of sex as something both banal and essential. No wonder so many people are rewatching it. Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/16/too-much-review-lena-dunham-netflix,2025-07-16T16:53:46,The Guardian,UK,en

And here it is, your next flavoursome nugget of absolute delight  Bookish. This six-part detective drama was created by Mark Gatiss, written by Matthew Sweet and stars the former as Gabriel Book, a secondhand bookseller in postwar London. He carries a mysterious letter from Churchill as a result of his equally mysterious service in the war and this allows him to lend a hand with any passing police investigation that catches his eye.

Pan by Michael Clune review  a stunning debut of teen psychosis,"This wild ride of a novel is remarkable for the honesty of its treatment of both mental illness and adolescenceThe narrator of American nonfiction author Michael Clunes first novel is the 15-year-old Nicholas, who lives with his father in a housing development so cheap and deracinated it inspires existential terror. Its a place exposed to the raw death of the endless future, which at night in the midwest in winter is sometimes bare inches above the roofs. Just as frightening is Nicholass sense that anything can come in. One day in January, what comes into Nicholas is the god Pan  a possessing, deranging, life-threatening spirit. Or that, anyhow, is how Nicholas comes to interpret his increasingly disabling anxiety.Pan is remarkable for the honesty of its treatment of both mental illness and adolescence. It shows more successfully than any other book Ive read how these can be experienced as black magic  indeed, it allows that they might be black magic. Nicholas successfully prophesies trivial events the wind rising, someone saying the word diabetes and is haunted by a dead mouses squeak. Another boy finds a means of divination in a schlock fantasy novel. Even the pop anthem More Than a Feeling is a path to the uncanny its a song with a door in the middle of it  like the door on a UFO. Nicholas becomes convinced that he is perpetually at risk of leaving his body  specifically, that his lookingthinking could pour or leap out of his head  and his friends, also being 15 years old, are ready to believe it, too. They are easy prey for Ian, a college-age man who sets himself up as a small-time cult leader among these high-school kids. Ian particularly targets Nicholas, telling him that only they are capable of real thoughts the others in the group are Hollows who have Solid Mind, a deterministic mentality with no animating self. The sound of words from a Hollow mouth, says Ian, contains an abyss. Soon the group is staging rituals incorporating sex, drugs and animal sacrifice.

But among the many consequences of Donald Trumps open hostility toward Americas intelligence community is that no less a CIA critic than Tim Weiner now sounds like a defender.To understand why, Weiner  author of the unsparing history of the agency, the 2007 bestseller Legacy of Ashes  suggested a thought experiment in a recent interview imagine spending years as an intelligence officer, working diligently to subvert the Kremlin, only to watch the US stand with Russia, Iran and North Korea, as it did in February when it voted against a UN resolution condemning the invasion of Ukraine.

Donkey Kong Bananza review - delirious destruction derby takes hammer to platforming conventions,"Nintendo Switch 2 NintendoGiven that its hero can smash through any barrier  which is delightful fun in itself  Nintendos new 3D platformer has a surreal freeform audacityA lot rests on Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendos first major single-player Switch 2 game, it will set the quality bar for the console in the way Breath of the Wild did when the original Switch was released. But as the latest game from the team responsible for the exceptional 3D Mario series, it is already begrudged by some Nintendo fans as a distraction what could possibly be so exciting about a tie-wearing gorilla to justify making Bananza ahead of another Super Mario Odyssey?Donkey Kong demolishes those concerns. He demolishes a lot in Bananza. It may resemble a Mario 64-style 3D platformer on the surface, with its themed worlds festooned with giant bananas to sniff out and collect, but DKs fists show total disregard for the playground as built. All terrain is destructible. Mash the buttons and his powerful arms thump tunnels through hills, pound pristine lawns into muddy craters and tear up wodges of stone to swing as sledgehammers for even speedier landscaping.

To resolve your Snapchat dysmorphia, you get your real face remodelled to look like the ideal version of you that artificial intelligence has perfected on your phone screen.There is a fundamental problem with this, says Adam Lowe, whose Factum Foundation in Madrid is at the forefront of art and technology, digitally documenting artworks and cultural heritage sites around the world. When you have surgery to look like your best self as shown on a flat screen, the results in three-dimensional reality can be very odd indeed.

All my images are productions, I dont just happen to be there. I build a narrative and visit locations  its more like making a movie, its very intentional. I scout locations that connect to what I want to represent. This was a rugged area of northern Colorado. The shoot was really about speed and energy, and I wanted open spaces that could allow the cowboys to do what they wanted. I wanted harder surfaces and dramatic skies  although you never really know what youre going to get. I take references from historical paintings and drawings of the American west, and ideas I carry on pieces of paper, so I go with a visual feel of what I want to do. I wanted to separate the colours of the landscape the colour of the hat, the horse, its saddle blanket, were all selected deliberately. The image is all about power and grace  the gesture of the animal is so forceful, and the cowboy is so in control.

The freedom of heading out on my bike and not knowing where Im going to pitch my tent that night. Now that my children are aged seven and nine, I wanted to introduce them to the liberation of this kind of adventure. They adore a day out on their bikes, but this was to be our first multiday bike trip as a family of four, so it was crucial to find a route easy and fun enough to captivate them.The Maasroute follows the course of the Maas River as it meanders for 300 miles 484km through the Netherlands, from the inland city of Maastricht to the Hook of Holland, then loops back to Rotterdam. It forms part of the much longer Meuse cycle route EuroVelo 19 that stretches from the source of the Maas or Meuse as its known in France on the Langres plateau, travelling through the French and Belgian Ardennes before crossing into the Netherlands.

Following the ceremony, the double doors were opened wide, so friends and family could line the ramp all the way to the edge of the lagoon. There, standing majestically at the end of a green gondola, was Adrianas childhood friend Giulia, a champion of voga Veneta, or Venetian rowing, ready to take the couple to the other side of the island for lunch.While Giulia rowed Adriana and Thom around the island, the rest of us walked across it to Trattoria Da Romano, where Adrianas family have celebrated for lifetimes, and it was completely given over to our euphoric wedding party. I am sure I would remember all seven courses several of which involved more than one dish even if I didnt have the menu memento stuck to our fridge with a cat magnet. What I remember most vividly, though, is the fish risotto, because Adriana told me to get near enough the kitchen door to see how energetically the chefs beat it, and how soft and rippling the texture was.

What to do if your driving licence is either lost or stolen,"From contacting police, to applying for a replacement, to keeping an eye on bank accounts, be sure to act quickly to protect all your personal detailsMislaying your driving licence, or having it stolen, can be a real hassle and leave you vulnerable to fraud, so it is important to act quickly to protect your personal information.Contact your local police station or call 101 to report a stolen full or provisional licence. They will then give you a crime reference number. This can be important if your licence is used for fraudulent activity later on. If youve misplaced it, this isnt a necessary step, but can be a good idea if you think theres a chance it might have been stolen.Apply for a replacement licence through the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency DVLA website if you are in England, Scotland and Wales or the DVA in Northern Ireland, or by phone and post. If you are applying by post, you will need to complete and send the D1 application for a driving licence form, which is available from most post offices. You can also apply by phone, but only if you have a photocard driving licence and none of your details have changed. A new licence costs 20.Keep an eye on your bank accounts for any suspicious activity, just in case your licence is being used for identity theft. It is a good idea to notify your bank, too, so they can flag any suspicious activity.Consider getting identity theft protection if you are worried about fraud. These services monitor your credit for any unusual activity. You can apply for protective registration with Cifas, the UKs fraud prevention service  this costs 30 for two years. Experians Identity Plus offers a similar service  its free for 30 days and 10.99 a month after.In the UK you are allowed to drive while you wait for a new licence to arrive.Make a record of your new driving licence number  its the unique 16-character code that can be found underneath the licences expiry date.Keep it in a secure place, to avoid losing it, or having it stolen again. If the police pull you over while driving, youre allowed up to a week to take your licence into your local police station, so you dont need to carry it on you at all times.Set up alerts for your bank accounts to stay ahead of any large or unusual transactions, and be extra cautious with your personal details in the future.If you find your old licence after youve applied for, or received, a new one, you need to return it to the DVLA with a note explaining what has happened. You can find the address on the Gov.uk website.

Sali Hughes on beauty Ive got a real problem with neck creams. Heres why,"Collagen-boosting retinoids and antioxidants do hold their own south of the chin, but ensure you lather on sunscreen first and foremostIf youve ever kindly searched for a recommendation of a neck cream from me, then youll know there are virtually none on record. This is because, despite so many being marketed in my direction and so many requests for a column about the best of them, I am consistently grumpy about neck products on principle. I certainly dont neglect my own neck in my routine, and encourage anyone engaged in their appearance to take good care of their entire skin, scalp to toe. And I can obviously understand why people seek out a specialist neck treatment when they notice changes in firmness and texture on the throat. But skin doesnt become different when it passes the jawline, it responds in the same way to TLC as the face, so I can see few good reasons for spending extra money.The things we know can help produce collagen lost on the face and neck as we age, naturally or prematurely, are retinoids and, to a lesser degree, antioxidants like vitamin C.

I wont have access to emails. Yeah, right. Sorry, you arent fooling anyone no one goes on holiday without their phone in 2025. Your office know perfectly well that if you dont answer emails, they can still reach you by text or direct message. Even, theoretically, by actually calling you, although obviously that wont happen because thats another thing that no one does in 2025. Tweak your out of office message as much as you like  you might as well stick your fingers in your ears.No, the best way to set your brain to holiday mode is by signing out of your Work Bag. Swapping the bag you take on your daily commute for a free-and-easy alternative is more effective as a psychological gear change than logging out of your emails. In day-to-day life, I change handbags as rarely as possible, the potential for leaving keys in an inside pocket and getting locked out being just too real. But when you get home after work and you arent going back for a week or two, there is something very pleasing about marking that moment by throwing away leaky pens, marvelling at how you managed to accumulate 14 hairbands, and then shaking the bag over the bin and feeling disproportionately thrilled when a pound coin falls out.

How TikToks morningshed went viral,"Are people applying layers of products, masks and tape to their faces at bedtime following a beneficial beauty trend, or is the practice problematic?The women in the videos begin by liberally applying layers of skincare products. Then come the sheet masks two under the eyes, one across the whole face, and perhaps another for the neck. A silk bonnet is placed over the hair, a chinstrap wraps the jaw and, as a final touch, a cartoonish, lip-shaped sticker is placed over the mouth, sealing it shut. And thats the simplified version.Welcome to the tyranny of morningshed, the viral TikTok trend in which creators apply multiple, increasingly absurd layers of skincare products, masks and accessories before bed, hoping to uncover a flawless complexion when they peel them away the following morning. We arent talking about the comparatively simple serums and essences that made up the once-popular 12-step Korean-inspired routines. Now, its chinstraps to lift the jawline, hydrogel masks infused with ultra-low molecular collagen to smooth, and adhesive tape applied to the skin to restrict wrinkling. I was going to liken it to Patrick Batemans morning routine in American Psycho, but having rewatched that scene, his gel cleanser, exfoliating scrub and face mask ritual feels decidedly lower maintenance.

Before the road came in 1980, his village on the jagged coast of south-west Turkeys Lycia region was extremely remote, isolated by steep valleys and mountains plunging into the sea. It took his family two days to get to the city of Fethiye on winding donkey tracks, to sell their apricots, vegetables and honey at the market.

An hours drive west of Istanbul, it was famed for its lavender, its yoghurt, and its summer houses dotted along the Marmara Sea.

This is the prison that since March has held the Istanbul mayor  and rival to president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan  Ekrem İmamoğlu, as he awaits trial for corruption  and now, the place where he has been given a twenty month sentence, in another of the litany of charges against him, for insulting and threatening a public official.It started taking in prisoners in 2008. Turkish coverage at the time marvelled at the size. Here was a complex  a campus, in the new lingo  made of nine separate prisons, spread across almost 1m sq metres, and with a stated capacity of 11,000 people. For the on-site staff alone, there were 500 apartments, a mosque, a market and restaurant, and a primary school for their children.

"Clean energy should be a priority, not wuthering Brontë country nostalgia  Letters","Readers respond to an article by Simon Jenkins about a proposed windfarm in the PenninesRe Simon Jenkins article Ed Miliband would let a turbine farm destroy Brontë country. We need net zero, but at what cost?, 14 July, there might be good reasons for opposing a windfarm on the Yorkshire moors, but Emily Brontë isnt one of them. Nor is the turbulent romance of Wuthering Heights an appropriate filter through which to view the Pennines. The Brontës local landscape would have changed considerably in their lifetime. They would have seen the rapid industrialisation of nearby towns such as Bradford and Halifax, and the mills that sprang up along the river in Haworth.They would have recognised the benefits of the expansion of the railways despite the impact on the countryside their brother, Branwell, worked as a railway clerk. The historic Brontë village of Haworth where they grew up was not a rural idyll, but a breeding ground for cholera and typhoid. The Brontë sisters must have applauded the campaign by their father, Patrick, for improved sanitation there, leading to the creation of a local reservoir that doubtless affected the countryside but also saved lives.

Wealth redistribution is good for growth  Letters,"A fairer spread of wealth and income would lead to demand for goods and services, writes Roger Brown. Plus, Alan Craw says England should follow Wales in considering a land value taxThe reasons that Andy Beckett adduces for Labour foregrounding the redistribution of wealth are all valid and appropriate Why is Labour so afraid to admit that we must tax the rich? 11 July. But there is one that is even more compelling and even more central to government priorities.Far from wealth redistribution being inimical to economic growth, there is overwhelming evidence  not least from international organisations like the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  that redistribution to ensure a fairer distribution of income and wealth is extremely positive for economic growth, the main reason being that the less well off spend a higher proportion of their more limited incomes, whereas the better off tend to save or invest in their assets there is no or very little trickling down. In fact, as a result of increased economic inequality, and even though interest rates remain historically low, the major anglophone economies continue to suffer a classic case of what Keynes called underconsumption due to the inability of the poorer members of society to keep up previous levels of demand for goods and services.Roger BrownAuthor of The Inequality Crisis Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/16/wealth-redistribution-is-good-for-growth,2025-07-16T17:00:25,The Guardian,UK,en
