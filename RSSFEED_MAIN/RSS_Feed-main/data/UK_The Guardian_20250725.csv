The Assassin review  Keeley Hawess menopausal hitwoman drama is perfectly crafted TV,"Stylish, witty, tightly written this tale of a retired killer going on the run with her adult son is massively entertaining. Hawes just gets better and betterA menopausal assassin has been a long time coming, even though there is literally no more perfect pairing in the world than a woman rapidly emptying of oestrogen and a gun. I blame the patriarchy, but I understand its unwillingness to confront the truth that if women were free to express themselves instead of raised in mental straitjackets, then armed at 40, the world would look very different indeed.Keeley Hawes, who just gets better and more impressive with every outing, is that menopausal assassin, in the aptly named six-part series The Assassin. Julie is her name and trying to live quietly in Greece and spurning every overture of friendship in the village is her game. Alas, she is called by her handler Damian, after 10 years of quietude, to perform one more time. This happens just as her son Edward Freddie Highmore, absolutely shining in what is essentially a light comic part in a bloody, murderous caper comes to visit for the first time in four years too! Even hitwomen have to juggle home and work demands. Oh, and Edwards gone vegan since they last spoke and she got wagyu steaks in for tea. Handlers and kids, eh? Anyway, Edwards here to ask her about the fortune that landed in his account when he turned 30 and if its anything to do with the father she has always refused to tell him about. She, more or less, tells him to shut up and eat his goddamn tofu.

Ukraine war briefing Anti-corruption agencies endorse bill restoring their independence,"EU welcomes reversal as essential to European support for Ukraine US announces US330m in further military sales. What we know on day 1,248The Ukrainian anti-corruption body, Nabu, said a new bill submitted to parliament on Thursday restores all procedural powers and guarantees of independence of the Nabu and Sapo. Nabu investigates corruption cases and Sapo prosecutes them. A Nabu statement said both agencies took part in the preparation of the new law and they urged the parliament to adopt the presidents initiative  in its entirety as soon as possible. This will prevent threats to criminal proceedings brought by the Nabu and the Sapo.The EU welcomed Volodymyr Zelenskyys move to reinstate the independence of the anti-corruption agencies after the shock adoption this week of a bill that stripped their autonomy. After protests on the streets and from international allies of Ukraine, the Ukrainian president said the further bill would ensure the rule of law and the independence of the anti-corruption agencies. An EU spokesperson said We provide significant financial support to Ukraine and this is conditional to progress and transparency, judicial reform and democratic governance. Those points were reinforced by European leaders with whom Zelenskyy consulted over the crisis, including Ursula von der Leyen, Friedrich Merz of Germany and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer.There were tensions over the Ukraine war as EU officials met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday. Antonio Costa, the European Council president, said the EU officials discussed at length their expectations for China to discourage Russia in its war against Ukraine.

Xi told EU to properly handle differences and frictions  The current challenges facing Europe do not come from China.A Russian attack killed three family members already displaced by the war, authorities announced on Thursday. The father, mother and son had fled to the village of Pidlyman in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine after Russian forces invaded their home town. A strike later on Kharkiv city wounded 33 people, including a 10-year-old girl, a 17-year-old boy and girl, the governor said. A separate Russian drone and missile barrage wounded seven people including a child in the central Ukrainian region of Cherkasy, emergency services said.The US state department on Thursday said it had approved military sales worth US330m to Ukraine comprising 150m worth of maintenance, repair and overhaul capability for M109 self-propelled howitzers, and 180m to sustain air defences. The Pentagon said contractors involved would include BAE Systems, Allison Transmission, Daimler Truck North America, Sierra Nevada Corporation, Radionix and Systems Electronic Export. The US on Wednesday announced sales of 322m related to Hawk surface-to-air missiles and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.Reuters are reporting that an Indian company shipped 1.4m worth of an explosive used in missile warheads, rocket motors and bombs to Russia in December 2024 despite the threat of US sanctions, according to Indian customs data seen by the news agency. One Russian company listed as receiving the compound, known as HMX or octogen, was an explosives manufacturer, which Ukraines SBU security service has linked to Moscows military. An SBU official said Ukraine launched a drone attack in April against one of the companys factories.The US government has identified HMXoctogen as critical for Russias war effort. The US state department did not comment to Reuters on the specific shipments but said it had repeatedly communicated to India that companies doing military-related business with Russia were at risk of sanctions.

There is more financial hardship than there used to be, their salaries dont go as far as ours did when we were training, and they have amassed more student debt.

As popular as professional wrestling became during the 1980s, its ins and outs were not as well-publicized as the highlights of more superficially respectable sports such as football, baseball and basketball. Even non-sporty 80s kids could probably name a bunch of teams and a few ultra-famous players such as Michael Jordan, Joe Montana or Darryl Strawberry. Wrestlers, meanwhile, were essentially both the players and the teams, which should have made them easier to differentiate  but, in reality, made the whole thing seem like a TV show that you either watched, or you didnt. Hulk Hogan, who died this week just shy of 72, was different. For better or worse.Hogan, born Terry Bollea, had a wrestling career that synced near-perfectly with wrestlings growing 1980s-era popularity. After bouncing between the World Wrestling Federation the Vince McMahon-run organization now known as WWE and the American Wrestling Association in the early 80s, Hogan returned to the WWF in 1983 and presided over an outbreak of what was diagnosed as Hulkamania. Even those who received the proper vaccinations against Hulkamania  namely, not paying attention to wrestling  could see the symptoms manifesting in others, and especially in the Hulkster himself. The red-and-yellow shirt he would tear off, the biker stache, the bandanna atop his thinning blond mane became instantly recognizable trademarks even for non-fans.

The Guardian view on Ukraines protests Zelenskyy must heed critics at home and abroad  Editorial,"Stripping anti-corruption agencies of their independence was a terrible  and unpopular  move. There are broader lessons for the president in this crisisWhen Russian troops rolled across the border in 2022, it established a new contract between Ukrainians and their president. The existential need for unity was cemented by admiration for Volodymyr Zelenskyys courage, and recognition of his ability to articulate the national mood and rally international support.Ordinary politics were suspended. Critics who were already suspicious of his populist instincts and centralising tendencies did not want to aid Russias cause. They understood that wartime could require a different mode of leadership. This informal contract essentially held despite growing concerns about the concentration of power, the role of Mr Zelenskyys right-hand man, Andriy Yermak, and the departure of popular figures seen as potential rivals  notably the military chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi, now ambassador to London, and the foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Guardian view on global inequality the rising tide that leaves most boats behind  Editorial,"The worlds assets are piling up in the hands of the few as growth is built on widening gaps. Thats not just unfair  its economically unsustainableThis years global wealth report by the City bank UBS confirms what is self-evident but rarely confronted while riches are accumulating, their distribution remains starkly unbalanced. In the 56 countries and economic areas surveyed, the report says global personal wealth grew 4.6 in 2024. However, not all boats have been lifted by this tide. The gap is growing between those who hold assets and those who dont.The figures are shocking just 60m of the worlds adults  1.6 of the population  have net personal wealth of 226tn, or 48.1 of all the worlds riches. At the other extreme, four in 10 adults  1.57bn people  have only 2.7tn, or just 0.6 of all the worlds personal wealth.

The answer may give England fans an extra glimmer of hope for Sundays Womens Euro 2025 final because all of those competitions were won by the team who contested the first semi-final, 24 hours earlier than their opponents in the final.Most womens football tournaments used to schedule the semi-finals for the same day but, since that began to change about 20 years ago, it has been a trend in international tournaments for the winners to have come from the first semi-final. As the Lionesses prepare to meet Spain, who came through their semi-final against Germany a day later than Englands comeback win over Italy, it begs the question how much of an advantage could it offer to Sarina Wiegmans team?

Stokes and Archer Bowling dream team combine to show England what could be  Simon Burnton,"Six months ago these special scenes were a distant fantasy but display against India offered glimpse into futureEarlier this year Harry Kane spoke about how he somehow managed to be constantly criticised even as he approached the extraordinary landmark of 400 career goals. Its like when Ronaldo and Messi were throwing these crazy numbers out there and the next season theyd score 40 goals instead of 50 and it was like they were having a bad season, he said. People take it for granted and maybe a little bit with England as well  people just expect it so its not spoken about so much. Maybe people just get a little bit bored of what you do.For each of the past 11 seasons Kane has played at least 30 games and scored at least 20 goals, and perhaps this is how players are punished for consistency of performance and fitness. Because the opposite is also true when players appear only rarely, when they play at a level that is seldom seen, well, that simply demands to be relished. Nothing is more cherished than the ephemeral. Nobody wishes on a static star.

Mass adoption of electric vehicles, considered a somewhat fanciful future when it began in 2014, has been embraced as an integral part of dealing with the climate emergency. Still, Formula E is intent on continuing to build a championship that remains a sustainable and entertaining series. The task it faces is persuading the public to pay attention.Those opening years did nothing to help the cause. A decade ago the cars that trundled round Battersea Park in London did little to sell the future of electric racing. They were slow and unwieldy, and sounded rather like disgruntled hairdryers. Worst of all, with batteries unable to last an entire race, drivers had to change car at the midway point.

Pre-tax profits of 1.8bn in its second quarter beat expectations, and the bank has told investors that it now expects income for the year to land above 16bn, compared with previous guidance of between 15.2bn and 15.bn.Its strategy of simplification, cost reduction, and technology integration  combined with sensible bolt-on acquisitions  is driving income growth and greater profitability. The addition of Sainsburys Bank, in particular, provides a real platform for further growth in UK retail banking.Now fully in private ownership, NatWest has a freer hand to make its next big strategic move and, in the interim, shareholders are being well rewarded for their patience with a sizeable dividend increase and share buyback programme.Since 31 December 2024, the near-term economic growth outlook has weakened. This was mainly due to the weaker economic performance in the second half of 2024 and the drag from international trade policy related uncertainty.

Andy Goldsworthy has laid a sheepskin rug up the classical gallerys grand staircase  very luxurious, except its made from the scraps thrown away after shearing, stained blue or red with farmers marks, all painstakingly stitched together with thorns.This is the Clarksons Farm of art retrospectives, plunging todays urbanites into the raw sadness and beauty, the violence and slow natural cycles of the British countryside. Goldsworthy may love nature but he doesnt sentimentalise it. At the top of the stairs theres a screen and through its gaps you glimpse the galleries beyond. It feels mystical and calming, until you realise its made of rusty barbed wire strung between two of the buildings columns that serve as tightly-wound wire rollers. It made me think of Magnus Mills darkly hilarious rural novel about hapless fencers, The Restraint of Beasts.

Chief of War to Hurricane Katrina the seven best shows to stream this week,"Jason Momoa takes the lead role in this epic, violent dramatised story of Hawaiian history. Plus, a gripping five-part documentary series to mark 20 years since the horrific Gulf of Mexico stormAn epic history lesson, courtesy of the mountainous Jason Momoa. When we first meet Kaiana Momoa he is something of a loner, capturing a shark with his bare hands and some rope. But he is coaxed back into armed service by the prophecy of an invasion that will lead to the unification of Hawaii. The drama is based on true events and great care has evidently been taken to present an authentic version of this undertold story. It is steeped in Polynesian cultural practices but it is also full of universal, action-adventure staples  namely, political machinations that periodically dissolve into prolonged outbreaks of expertly choreographed, frequently blood-curdling violence.

One Day in Southport review  a sombre portrait of how a tragedy was hijacked,"You could spend a lifetime trying to unpack last summers unrest following the murder of three young girls. This documentary chooses to be more of a mood pieceMost of the six to 10-year-old girls gathered in the Hart Space dance studio in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July last year for a Taylor Swift-themed workshop were making friendship bracelets Its a very Swiftie thing to do, says the older sister of one, who was watching them, when 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana burst in with a knife. His attack left two children dead at the scene and another died the next day from her injuries. Six other children, including the sister who was watching, and two adults were injured and taken to hospital.One Day in Southport focuses largely on what happened afterwards interspersed with the memories of the injured older girl and her family, because what happened next was the result of so many social, cultural and political issues that you could spend a lifetime unpacking them. This documentary does the best it can in an hour. It interviews people from different sides of the various debates, and shows social media posts and footage from the riots that sprang up around the country and caught the police and the establishment unawares. The prime minister was left floundering and unable to address the mixture of feelings and motivations behind them quickly or directly enough.

The god of small things celebrating Arvo Pärt at 90,"The Estonian composers music of simplicity, spirituality  and silence  is universally appealing and enduringly rewarding. We pay tribute ahead of his milestone birthdayIn many ways Arvo Pärt and John Williamss music couldnt be further apart. One celebrates simplicity, purity, and draws much of its inspiration from sacred texts the other captures strong emotions in sweeping orchestral scores. And yet the two men are todays most performed contemporary composers. Bachtracks annual survey of classical music performed across the world placed Pärt second John Williams is in the top spot in 2023 and 2024. In 2022, Pärt was first, Williams second. This year, Pärt might return to No 1 as concert halls and festivals worldwide celebrate his 90th birthday, on 11 September.Unlike many of his contemporaries, Pärt has found a way to speak across boundaries of culture, creed and generation. In the world of contemporary classical music, where complexity and empty virtuosity often dominate, Pärt stands apart. His music eschews spectacle in favour of silence, simplicity and spiritual depth. Pärt has outlasted political regimes, artistic fashions and shifting trends in composition, yet his work remains strikingly relevant. In a cultural moment saturated with information and spectacle, Pärt offers something almost universally appealing. As the commentator Alex Ross observed in a 2002 New Yorker article, Pärt has put his finger on something almost impossible to put into words, something to do with the power of music to obliterate the rigidities of space and time and silence the noise of self, binding the mind to an eternal present.

Ginastera String Quartets album review  compelling and colourful,"Kiera DuffyMiró QuartetPentatoneThe passionate settings of Spanish poetry in the Argentinian composers third string quartet are the real discovery of this career-spanning trilogyAlberto Ginastera divided his own composing career into three phases, and each of his string quartets falls conveniently into one of those phases. Composed in 1948, String Quartet No 1 belongs to what Ginastera called his period of objective nationalism, when, following the example of his teacher Aaron Copland, he incorporated the folk music of his native Argentina more or less unaltered into his own music 10 years later, in the subjective nationalism of the second quartet, those colouristic elements have been absorbed into the energised textures of his works, which are organised using Schoenbergs 12-note technique.As the Miró Quartets performances of the first two quartets show, both are attractive works, full of vivid incident, which deserve to be included in recitals far more often than they are. But its the third quartet thats the real discovery here. By the time it was composed in 1973, Ginastera was living in Europe he would die in Geneva in 1983 and in what he described as his neo-expressionism phase. Taking its cue from Schoenbergs second quartet, it adds a solo soprano to the lineup, for passionate, dramatic settings of texts by three 20th-century Spanish poets Juan Ramón Jiménez, Federico García Lorca and Rafael Alberti. The recording places the soprano, Kiera Duffy, rather farther forward than ideal, but theres no denying that the effect is totally compelling.

She recalls, for example, finally feeling that she has made it as a translator when she is invited to speak at the London Book Fair years later, she returns to tell the audience that she has plenty of work, but only 30 in her bank account because so many of the organisations in the room are behind on paying her.

His new book gets us rooting for two wealthy management consultants fresh out of Oxford, both of them men assuming you havent already tuned out. I suspect his agent might have found it easier to pitch a novel about sex criminals, not least because Drayton and Mackenzies approach is so unfashionably traditionalist its a chunky, warmly observed, 911-to-Covid saga that, while comic in tone and often extremely funny, doesnt labour under any obligation to send up its protagonists, still less take them down.James Drayton, born to north London academics, is a socially awkward high achiever who privately measures himself against Christopher Columbus and Napoleon.

The Lost Elms by Mandy Haggith review  cultural history of a noble tree,"Despite the ravages of Dutch elm disease, these once ubiquitous features of our landscape still loom largeJust as the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 did not originate in Spain, so Dutch elm disease is no fault of the Netherlands. It acquired the name thanks to the pioneering efforts of three Dutch scientists  Marie Beatrice Schol-Schwarz, Christine Buisman and Johanna Westerdijk  who identified the beetle-transported fungus that causes it in the 1920s. Nor is the so-called English elm Ulmus minor really English, inasmuch as it is thought to have been transferred here from Italy, so Reform UK party enthusiasts should probably agitate to repatriate all such specimens. More confidently thought native to these isles is the wych elm from the Old English for supple or Scots elm, which has long been thought to have healing and protective qualities. Our scholarly guide to this noble plant, Mandy Haggith, delves enthusiastically into such lore. The 17th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper said that elm was connected to the planet Saturn and that its leaves could fix broken bones. Modern healers promise that drinking a decoction of elm bark can purge phlegm and stop diarrhoea. Haggith cites a present-day Massachusetts-based herbalist and druid who claims that slippery elm milk is good for insomnia. It would be unkind to call this sort of thing merely barking. The author insists that a western scientific worldview in other words, a scientific worldview, shared by scientists in China and India is absolutely not the only way forests can be thought about, which is fair enough. But the fake cures of the wellness industry are not without their own ecological downsides as Haggith writes later, fashionable pseudo-remedies gone viral on TikTok or whatever can inspire the stripping of bark from healthy trees at injurious scale. Happily, elmwood was not only the preserve of quacks it was also a sought-after material in shipbuilding most of the hull of the fast clipper Cutty Sark was made of rock elm, and long before that for making spears and bows an iron age Celtic tribe was known as the ones who vanquish by the elm Lemovices. Medieval London, Bristol and other cities had running water delivered by mains pipes of elm. And elm is also the source of a famous insult when the great Samuel Johnson claimed that there was no Gaelic literature, a poet responded with the Gaelic for your head is made entirely of elm, especially your tongue and your gums. Luckily, although Dutch elm disease has killed hundreds of millions of trees since the early 20th century, the species is not lost, or even on the brink of extinction. Brighton, Haggith sees, is managing the blight well through city-wide surveillance and timely surgery. And the fossil record suggests that elms have previously suffered waves of pandemic disease before bouncing back. There will be time for more poetic mentions of elms of the kind the author rather exhaustively collects towards the end. Robert Frost was a big fan of elm trees  But the greater part of this books devotion, and its delight, is reserved for living specimens in their habitats. Two rows of elms, Haggith notes, can form a corridor for wildlife, dog walkers and feral children, or a church-like nave, an arch-shaped cloister that draws the eye towards a monastery in Beauly. A cheerfully self-described tree-hugger, she is inspired to her best writing by close observation of the trees themselves. On an elm growing horizontally out of the rock near a Scottish loch I stand beneath it, neck craned in awe, looking up into the lush green profusion of its living community. It is winter, so all this greenery isnt the trees own leaves, but photosynthesising life using it as a climbing frame. Elsewhere she finds beauty even in a diseased log, happily noting the beautiful doily pattern made by the brood-chamber and feeding passages of the grubs. And her enthusiasm is contagious. As someone who began this book with literally no idea what an elm looks like, I was inspired to download the Woodland Trust tree-ID app and resolve to pay more attention to our ligneous friends.

He demolishes a lot in Bananza.

Ensemble Intercontemporain Bleuse review  from a clown to a clarinet and Cathy Berberian,"Royal Albert Hall, LondonA late-night Prom devoted to the music of Berio and Boulez both born 100 years ago demonstrated the intricacy, zaniness and sheer imagination of the two composersTwin titans of the 20th-century avant garde, Luciano Berio and Pierre Boulez were born seven months apart in 1925. This well-crafted concert by Ensemble Intercontemporain, the orchestra Boulez founded in 1976, avoided the obvious hits while demonstrating just how different their music could be.Berios Sequenza V for solo trombone is one of 14 pieces he wrote to test the boundaries of particular instruments or vocal types. It was inspired by Grock, a Swiss-born clown and one-time neighbour of the composer, whose personality had fascinated him as a boy. Lucas Ounissi, ambling on in full circus slap and a lime-green wig, put his instrument through its paces. Juggling a handheld plunger mute, he rasped and farted away, frequently singing and playing at the same time. A virtuoso performance showed off the breadth of the composers imagination as well as his singular sense of humour.

Rosamund Pikes stage CV already has plenty of highs, from Hitchcock Blonde to Hedda Gabler, but her performance in Millers follow-up play has been keenly anticipated, given that it reunites some of the team that made Prima Facie a smash hit.This is an almost deliberate counterpoint to Prima Facie, in which a defence lawyer, expert at playing the system to demolish rape charges against her clients, is undone by her own experience of sexual assault. Miller wanted to highlight how poorly the law serves victims, and Inter Alia presents the same issue from the flipside with a female judge, determined to make the system more just, whose world is upended by an accusation close to home.

"What if everyone didnt die? The queer, Pulitzer-winning, happy-ending Hamlet","James Ijames was told Shakespeare wasnt for the likes of him. Yet his Hamlet revamp electrified Broadway and scooped up Tony nominations. As Fat Ham hits the UK, he talks violence, vengeance, strongmen and joyWhen he was still in his 20s and studying for a masters degree in acting, James Ijames was advised to take a swerve away from all things Shakespearean. His tutors thought his southern accent, the product of an upbringing in North Carolina, was not conducive to declaiming Elizabethan verse. Believing them, he did just one professional Shakespeare production in 10 full years of treading the boards.Now Ijames is righting that old wrong, although he does not see it quite that way. Fat Ham, his latest drama, is based on Hamlet and features a queer protagonist called Juicy, who is commanded by the ghost of his murdered father to avenge his death. Significantly, Juicy hails from a Black American family in North Carolina. The thing I kept hearing over and over, he says, was that my regionalism  the slowness of my southern accent  would make it difficult for me to do Shakespeare. I did avoid it for those reasons.

"Rachel Roddys rice salad with red peppers, celery, herbs and egg  recipe","The secret to a really good rice salad is temperature, herbs, good protein and to make sure its studded with flavourful vegetables  transparent bowl optionalA few weeks ago, when the weather turned boiling and the tarmac became soft, I made a bad rice salad. The principal reason for this was the overcooked rice, which was my fault for three reasons I was using a brand I have never used before and didnt read the packet I forgot to set the kitchen timer and I ignored my instinct to tip it out dog? Cake? Compost? Bin? and start again. To my overcooked rice I added not-tasty tomatoes, tough minced parsley, extra-virgin olive oil, a bit too much vinegar, olives, capers and hard-boiled eggs I also added an expensive tin of tuna, which did a brilliant job of making the whole thing taste better, although still not good. Everyone agreed that it was a depressing dinner, then we went out for ice-cream.The good thing about making a bad rice salad is the need to redeem and reassure myself that I am capable of making not only a good one, but a great one, though I do appreciate that todays first paragraph might make you doubt this. A good rice salad begins with well-cooked long-grain rice and involves a good balance of four vegetable elements raw tomatoes, red pepper, cucumber, celery, say, cooked beans, courgettes, peas, sweetcorn, vegetables preserved in oil peppers, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, aubergine, and pickled or salted vegetables dill pickles, olives, capers, caper berries. There should also be some form of protein, whether thats tuna, cheese, tofu, salami or wurstel possibly involve tender herbs be dressed with oil and a little vinegar and always be finished with egg slices, wedges or chopped  you decide.

One fabulous way to cook up a glut is scarpaccia, an Italian classic thats similar to farinata and a distant cousin of pizza.

Now she has lost all interest, and couples counselling doesnt helpI am a 48-year-old man. Both my wife and I come from a conservative background we believe that sex before marriage is a sin and saved ourselves until we got married in our early 30s. Before getting married, I masturbated but never had any real sex. Our first night turned out to be a disaster. I couldnt get an erection. However, as the days passed, we managed to have sex but not to my wifes satisfaction, because I finished within 30 seconds of penetration. I think I suffer from both erectile dysfunction ED and premature ejaculation PE. My ED is not consistent  I have been prescribed Viagra and use it sometimes  but my PE continues, and is taking a toll on us. My wife is uninterested in sex because she doesnt get anything out of it. It has been about 15 years now and we have two kids but our sex life has not improved. I tried couples counselling but that was more about building a bond between us which I believe is not an issue as we love each other and cant think about being with someone else. The only missing piece in our life is satisfying sex. I would do anything to satisfy my wife but I am feeling helpless.

What to do if your TfL Oyster or Zip card is lost or stolen,"From how to cancel it and the effect on the balance, there are steps you should consider takingOyster cards revolutionised travel across London, making it easier and faster to get across the capital, and despite the uptick in journeys now made with contactless payments, they are still used by many to get around. They are easy to misplace, however. If yours is lost, damaged or stolen, here are some tips to get you back on track.Check whether your card is registered to a Transport for London TfL account. If you lose an unregistered card, you cant get a refund or replacement, and will lose any pay-as-you-go credit.For a registered card, sign in to your TfL account and report it missing, stolen or faulty.

Your pay-as-you-go balance will transfer to your new card as long as youre registered, as will a travelcard or bus and tram pass if you have at least five days travel remaining.

You can do this by asking a member of staff at a station to connect them, so will need your railcard handy.Keep your Oyster card in a secure place, ideally not with other cards, so if you lose one, you dont lose them all.

How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? Youll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, its a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.The truth is that aside from the fact that people equate wearing fewer clothes with being cooler  not true!  its very hard to know what to wear when the sun comes out. So we are here to help. How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys thats cocktail-approved  and a hat the kids will actually wear?

The Ama sliders, in a choice of black, red or white, were launched by the American fashion brand The Row this week.

Back in the late 1990s, the ballroom hosted Pier 39, a sticky-floored nightclub where getting your heels wedged in the planks after too many vodkas was considered par for the course.

Women are the guardians of our culture why Kihnu is Estonias island of true equality,"They wear traditional dress, play ancient melodies on violins and accordions, but the women of this island outpost ensure that it is more than just a living museumWelcome to Kihnu. We are not a matriarchy, says Mare Mätas as she meets me off the ferry. Ive stepped on to the wild and windswept Kihnu island, which floats in the Gulf of Riga off Estonias western coast like a castaway from another time. Just four miles 7km long and two miles wide, this Baltic outpost is a world unto itself that has long been shielded from the full impact of modernity, a place where motorbikes share the road with horse-drawn carts, and women in bright striped skirts still sing ancient sea songs. But Kihnu is no museum  its a living, breathing culture all of its own, proudly cared for by its 700 or so residents.Mare, a traditional culture specialist and local guide, promptly ushers me into the open back of her truck and takes me on a whistlestop tour of the island, giving me a history quiz as we stop at the museum, the lighthouse, the cemetery and the school.

"Lookout, Devon! Our overnight stay in a 1940s observation post","A clifftop bunkhouse built for the RAF during the second world war is perfect for a kid-friendly escape  with great views, sea swims, hiking and otter spottingIts not always possible to take a holiday, but sometimes the yearning to be somewhere else, to leave the pressures of daily life behind, is too hard to ignore. Last bank holiday weekend, with a 13th birthday to celebrate and a row of suns on the weather app, we found a solution. Our family of four, plus two of my sons friends, would drive two hours west, to Devon. Wed stay by the sea, go cycling and swimming, play Perudo and sit around a campfire, eating birthday cake. And be home the next day. Wed be 24-hour party people. Only less rocknroll, more rock pools and bacon rolls.The catalyst was discovering Brandy Head on a Google Maps scroll. Like a mini youth hostel, sleeping six, with one double bed, two twin bunks, a shower room and an open-plan living, dining and kitchen area, this boxy little building sits on the clifftops between Sidmouth and Budleigh Salterton, accessible only on foot. Perched nearly 60m above sea level, its terrace is the big selling point, enjoying such gulls-eye views of the sea that it feels like surfing a very tall wave every time you step on to it.

Thrill of the night train from Vienna to Rome on the next-gen moonlight express,"Austrias upgraded sleeper proves an exciting way to travel between two absorbing, family-friendly cities for our writer and her young daughtersToasted ham baguettes in hand, we cheered as the new-generation Nightjet drew into Vienna Hauptbahnhof. It was a little before 7pm, and as the carriages hummed past I felt a rush of joy, like celebrity trainspotter Francis Bourgeois, but without the GoPro on my forehead. For more than three years Ive been documenting the renaissance of sleeper trains, and Id wondered if I might one day tire of them. But the thrill seems only to intensify each time I embark on another nocturnal adventure, this time with my two daughters  aged eight and five  who were already arguing over the top berth. The first four carriages were designated for travellers to the Italian port city of La Spezia, the other seven carrying on to Roma Tiburtina, where we would alight at 10am. Once in Rome we had 24 hours to eat classic carbonara, dark chocolate gelato, and bike around the Villa Borghese before taking a train to Florence.Austrian Federal Railways ÖBB has played the lead role in resuscitating Europes night trains. Towards the end of 2016, ÖBB launched its Nightjet network on 14 routes, using old rolling stock it bought from Deutsche Bahn. Then, to the delight of train nerds like me, it launched a brand-new fleet at the end of 2023, and now operates 20 routes across Europe. We were now on board this high-spec service, which smelled of freshly unpacked furniture, the carpets soft underfoot, the lighting adjustable to disco hues of neon blue and punk pink.

The delivery man arrived with the ashes in a gift bag  why are so many people opting out of traditional funerals?,"In the UK and the US, direct cremations  where no mourners are present and relatives and friends can organise their own ceremonies  are on the rise. Is it time to rethink how we say goodbye our loved ones?When my father-in-law, Cliff, died in March 2021 after being diagnosed with an aggressive and late-caught cancer, he didnt leave any funeral plans. Nor was there money squirrelled away to pay for them, even if he had. He was an ardent atheist, so a church service was out of the question, and pandemic restrictions had been limiting guest numbers, so my wife, Hayley, and her siblings decided to opt out of having a traditional funeral. Instead, they chose direct cremation, a service that minimises formalities  and, crucially, the cost. There is no funeral service the coffin is simply brought into the crematorium before it is cremated, after which the ashes are returned to the family.During an online consultation with death specialists Farewill, Hayley was quoted 1,062 for a direct cremation, more than 3,000 cheaper than the current average cost of a basic funeral. The only catch was that no one would attend the cremation, aside from those paid to carry it out. It seemed a cruel choice to some, who could not get their heads around the idea that there would not be a funeral to attend. But Hayley explained why it seemed like the perfect option they could obtain her fathers ashes without fuss and hold their own, intimate ceremony on the banks of the River Wye, where Cliff had loved to fish.

It seems to mean more than the rays of light, the play of dappled shadow more than the ephemeral quality of a green shade its an aesthetic experience of sunlight interacting with foliage.Today is the hottest day of a heatwave. The air is stifling. Sunlight is burning. Under a canopy of leaves, a small wing lands on the table where Im writing this in a notebook. How did it get here?

When we played a kids game, the dark clouds parted and my life took a radical turnI was halfway through a yoga session when it happened. I was sitting opposite a stranger and we were about to do a clapping exercise together, like a childs game of pat-a-cake. I didnt feel awkward, or silly I went for it and gave it everything. It was as if the clouds parted and the sunlight shone through. I felt a huge sense of relief, as if I had just found something I had been looking for.I was in my late 20s, and Id had chronic depression since my teens. It would come in waves, and I could see another wave heading towards me. After a photography degree, and a couple of years working at a picture library, I had been desperate to break into the media and, in 2003, I was really excited about getting a job on a magazine picture desk.

As an adult, she helped expose the shocking scale of abuse it had perpetratedUntil she was six, Philippa Barnes was surrounded by things that were hers.

She had a close-knit family a mum, dad, two brothers and a sister, and grandparents who lived near the family home in Surrey. When her mum made lemon meringue pie, she would pass the curd pan out of the window to where Philippa was playing so she could lick it clean.One day, when Philippa was about two years old, a couple stopped by the familys church. They, along with their three sons, were on their way to join the Jesus Fellowship, a Christian community in Northamptonshire led by Noel Stanton, a charismatic, white-haired pastor.

Water firms should serve the common good  Letters,"Jeffrey Henderson suggests legally requiring water and other private companies to operate in the interests of the British public, while Peter Bowden favours the Green partys clear commitment to renationalisationThe Water Commissions failure to consider renationalisation as an option for the industry does not necessarily mean that well watch the industry continue to sink under the failed model of privatisation, as the Green partys co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, has suggested Less reorganising, more doing landmark report alone wont fix broken water sector, 21 July. But, as you say in your editorial 21 July, it will mean that making water companies value the public interest more highly, relative to private profit, will be an ongoing struggle.There is a way, however, of ensuring that the public interest wins this struggle. Change the laws on corporate governance. Legally require water and other private companies to operate in the interests of the common good, and develop a regulatory system to ensure that this happens. This would make it easier to prosecute CEOs and other senior executives, should they fail to run their companies in the interests of the British people. In legislating this way, the government could take its lead from the German constitution, article 14, clause 2 of which states Property entails obligations. Its use shall also serve the public good.
